## Documentation & Comments
- Keep API docs tight: brief, exact, and unambiguous.
- Open with a single-sentence summary of what the method does.
- Begin that summary with a third-person singular verb (e.g., “Returns”, “Parses”, “Validates”).
- Use precise technical terminology—avoid vagueness.
- Document observable behavior, not implementation details.
- Standardize wording for recurring actions; choose one term and stick with it.
- Use Doxygen block comments: /** ... */.
- For each parameter, list name, type, allowed range/constraints, and purpose.
- Specify the return type, meaning, and the exact conditions under which values are produced.
- State clearly whether any input arguments are mutated.
- Align with the broader codebase—check for consistency before finalizing docs.
- Enumerate all exceptions/errors the method may raise and when they occur.
